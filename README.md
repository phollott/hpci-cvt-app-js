- scan the QR code generated when this project build started (expo start)
  - **android users:** the QR scanner is built within the Expo Client app! ðŸ¤—
  - **ios 11 and later:** you can open your camera app to scan the QR code, apple made the Expo folks remove the QR scanner from the app for some reason... ðŸ¤”
  - **ios 10 and below:** work around to [get expo running on older iOS devices](https://blog.calebnance.com/expo/getting-expo-to-work-on-older-iphones-with-no-qr-support.html)
