## install

First, make sure you have Expo CLI installed: `npm install -g expo-cli`

Install: `yarn` or `yarn install`

Run Project Locally: `expo start` or `yarn dev`

## development on a physical device

- first, your machine and physical device should be on the same wifi connection
- make sure you have Expo CLI installed globally, if not run:
  - `npm install -g expo-cli`
- then navigate to this project's directory on your machine and run:
  - `yarn dev` or `expo start`
- now download the Expo Client app on your preferred physical device:
  - **Android:** [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
  - **Apple:** [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)
- scan the QR code generated when this project build started (expo start)
  - **android users:** the QR scanner is built within the Expo Client app! ðŸ¤—
  - **ios 11 and later:** you can open your camera app to scan the QR code, apple made the Expo peeps remove the QR scanner from the app for some reason... ðŸ¤”
  - **ios 10 and below:** i wrote about a work around to [get expo running on older iOS devices](https://blog.calebnance.com/expo/getting-expo-to-work-on-older-iphones-with-no-qr-support.html)
